problems
========

I enjoy solving problems in Ruby. Especially love [Codewars](https://codewars.com/) and [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)

Project Euler has really good problems, but there are small amount of solutions, especially in particular language.

CodeWars is amazing website, where you can learn a lot from others code.

My accounts [Codewars was #20](https://www.codewars.com/users/zishe) and [Project Euler 66 problems solved](https://projecteuler.net/profile/zishe.png)
