problems
========

I enjoy solving problems in Ruby. Especially love [Codewars](http://codewars.com/) and [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/)

Project Euler has really good problems, but there are small amount of solutions, especially in particular language.

CodeWars is amazing website, where you can learn a lot from others code.

My accounts [Codewars #20](https://glacial-scrubland-1746.herokuapp.com/users/leaderboard) and [Project Euler 65 problems solved](http://projecteuler.net/profile/zishe.png)
