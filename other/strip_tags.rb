<text start="23.002" dur="7.069">There&#39;s No Tomorrow</text>
<text start="47.007" dur="1.999">This is the earth,</text>
<text start="49.005" dur="2.029">as it looked 90 million years ago.</text>
<text start="51.034" dur="3.974">
Geologists call this period the &#39;Late Cretaceous&#39;.
</text>
<text start="55.008" dur="2.992">It was a time of extreme global warming,</text>
<text start="58.05" dur="2">When dinosaurs still ruled the planet.</text>
<text start="61.01" dur="1.05">They went about their lives,</text>
<text start="62.079" dur="2.95">
secure in their place at the top of the food chain,
</text>
<text start="67.05" dur="2.959">oblivious of the changes taking place around them.</text>
<text start="71" dur="1.034">The continents were drifting apart,</text>
<text start="72.035" dur="3">opening huge rifts in the Earth&#39;s crust.</text>
<text start="75.07" dur="2.989">They flooded, becoming seas.</text>
<text start="80.003" dur="2.031">Algae thrived in the extreme heat,</text>
<text start="82.038" dur="1.012">poisoning the water.</text>
<text start="85.02" dur="1.009">They died,</text>
<text start="86.05" dur="2.043">
and fell, in their trillions, to the bottom of the rifts.
</text>
<text start="92.002" dur="2.027">Rivers washed sediment into the seas,</text>
<text start="94.05" dur="1.977">
until the organic remains of the algae were buried.
</text>
<text start="98.005" dur="2.999">As the pressure grew, so did the heat,</text>
<text start="101.002" dur="2.032">until a chemical reaction transformed the organics</text>
<text start="103.042" dur="2.048">into hydrocarbon fossil fuels:</text>
<text start="106.002" dur="3">Oil and Natural Gas.</text>
<text start="109.01" dur="2.024">A similar process occurred on land,</text>
<text start="111.064" dur="2">which produced coal.</text>
<text start="115.002" dur="2.033">It took nature about 5 million years</text>
<text start="117.04" dur="4.014">
to create the fossil fuels that the world consumes in 1 year.
</text>
<text start="122.005" dur="1.029">The modern way of life</text>
<text start="123.04" dur="2.994">is dependent on this fossilised sunlight,</text>
<text start="126.05" dur="3.965">
although a surprising number of people take it for granted.
</text>
<text start="133.008" dur="4.086">
Since 1860, geologists have discovered over 2 trillion barrels of oil.
</text>
<text start="138.09" dur="3.964">Since then, the world has used approximately half.</text>
<text start="146" dur="3.014">Before you can pump oil, you have to discover it.</text>
<text start="150" dur="3.006">
At first it was easy to find, and cheap to extract.
</text>
<text start="153.006" dur="3.03">The first great American oilfield was Spindletop,</text>
<text start="156.09" dur="2.916">discovered in 1900</text>
<text start="159.003" dur="1.047">Many more followed.</text>
<text start="161.003" dur="2.002">Geologists scoured America.</text>
<text start="163.005" dur="4.004">
They found enormous deposits of oil, natural gas and coal.
</text>
<text start="168.004" dur="3.018">America produced more oil than any other country,</text>
<text start="171.044" dur="2.958">enabling it to become an industrial super-power.</text>
<text start="176.001" dur="1.097">Once an oil well starts producing oil,</text>
<text start="177.098" dur="3.934">
it&#39;s only a matter of time before it enters a decline.
</text>
<text start="182.003" dur="2.091">Individual wells have different production rates.</text>
<text start="185.061" dur="1.939">When many wells are averaged together,</text>
<text start="187.019" dur="2.033">the combined graph looks like a bell curve.</text>
<text start="189.052" dur="1.985">Typically</text>
<text start="191.037" dur="3.003">it takes 40 years after the peak of discovery</text>
<text start="194.041" dur="2.009">for a country to reach its peak of production,</text>
<text start="197.032" dur="2.037">after which it enters a permanent fall.</text>
<text start="200.094" dur="1.963">In the 1950s,</text>
<text start="202.057" dur="2.977">Shell geophysicist M. King Hubbert</text>
<text start="205.038" dur="3.02">
predicted that America&#39;s oil production would peak in 1970,
</text>
<text start="208.081" dur="3.997">40 years after the peak of U.S. oil discovery.</text>
<text start="213.005" dur="1.995">Few believed him.</text>
<text start="215.004" dur="2.002">However, in 1970,</text>
<text start="217.006" dur="2">American oil production peaked,</text>
<text start="219.006" dur="2">and entered a permanent decline.</text>
<text start="222.005" dur="2.045">Hubbert was vindicated.</text>
<text start="225.019" dur="1.013">From this point on,</text>
<text start="226.015" dur="3.065">America would depend increasingly on imported oil.</text>
<text start="230.005" dur="3.003">This made her vulnerable to supply disruptions,</text>
<text start="233.038" dur="3.971">and contributed to the economic mayhem of the 1973</text>
<text start="237.009" dur="2.05">and 1979 oil shocks.</text>
<text start="241.09" dur="4.918">
The 1930s saw the highest rate of oil discoveries in U.S. history.
</text>
<text start="246.019" dur="1.076">In spite of advanced technology,</text>
<text start="247.095" dur="4.977">
the decline in the discovery of new American oilfields has been relentless.
</text>
<text start="254.007" dur="2.083">More recent finds, such as ANWAR,</text>
<text start="257.006" dur="3.083">would at best provide enough oil for 17 months.</text>
<text start="262.005" dur="3.016">
Even the new &quot;Jack 2&quot; field in the gulf of Mexico
</text>
<text start="265.021" dur="2.988">would only supply a few months of domestic demand.</text>
<text start="269.002" dur="2.074">
Though large, neither field comes close to satisfying
</text>
<text start="271.076" dur="2.924">America&#39;s energy requirements.</text>
<text start="276.003" dur="1.007">Evidence is now mounting</text>
<text start="277.01" dur="3.067">
that world oil production is peaking, or is close to it.
</text>
<text start="281.009" dur="5.023">
Globally, the rate of discovery of new oilfields peaked in the 1960s.
</text>
<text start="286.089" dur="0.992">Over 40 years later,</text>
<text start="287.081" dur="2.008">the decline in the discovery of new fields</text>
<text start="290" dur="1.05">seems unstoppable.</text>
<text start="294.001" dur="2.049">54 of the 65 major oil producing nations</text>
<text start="296.05" dur="2.048">have already peaked in production.</text>
<text start="301.005" dur="3.05">
Many of the others are expected to follow in the near future.
</text>
<text start="306.009" dur="1.071">The world will need to bring the equivalent</text>
<text start="307.08" dur="2.93">of a new Saudi Arabia into production</text>
<text start="310.014" dur="0.075">every three years</text>
<text start="310.094" dur="3.908">
to make up for declining output in existing oilfields.
</text>
<text start="315.089" dur="0.976">In the nineteen sixties,</text>
<text start="316.065" dur="3.966">
six barrels of oil were found for every one that was used.
</text>
<text start="321.01" dur="1">Four decades later,</text>
<text start="322.022" dur="3.03">
the world consumes between three and six barrels of oil
</text>
<text start="325.055" dur="1.967">for every one that it finds.</text>
<text start="329.002" dur="2.017">Once the peak of world oil production is reached,</text>
<text start="331.03" dur="2.05">demand for oil will outstrip supply,</text>
<text start="333.088" dur="2.939">and the price of gasoline will fluctuate wildly,</text>
<text start="336.027" dur="3.008">affecting far more than the cost of filling a car.</text>
<text start="341.08" dur="2.922">Modern cities are fossil fuel dependent.</text>
<text start="344.019" dur="2.015">Even roads are made from asphalt,</text>
<text start="346.035" dur="1.05">a petroleum product,</text>
<text start="347.094" dur="1.98">as are the roofs of many homes.</text>
<text start="351.009" dur="1.997">Large areas would be uninhabitable</text>
<text start="353.013" dur="4.003">
without heating in the winter or air conditioning in the summer.
</text>
<text start="358.009" dur="2.084">
Suburban sprawl encourages people to drive many miles
</text>
<text start="360.093" dur="2">to work, school and stores.</text>
<text start="364.003" dur="2.042">Major cities have been zoned with residential</text>
<text start="366.045" dur="2.028">and commercial areas placed far apart,</text>
<text start="368.073" dur="1.987">forcing people to drive.</text>
<text start="371.006" dur="1.08">Suburbia, and many communities</text>
<text start="372.086" dur="3.964">
were designed on the assumption of plentiful oil and energy.
</text>
<text start="379.05" dur="1.998">Chemicals derived from fossil fuels,</text>
<text start="381.048" dur="1.976">or Petro-chemicals,</text>
<text start="383.024" dur="1">
are essential in the manufacture of countless products.
</text>
<text start="388.004" dur="1.085">The modern system of agriculture</text>
<text start="390.01" dur="2.001">is heavily dependent on fossil fuels,</text>
<text start="392.044" dur="1">as are hospitals,</text>
<text start="393.064" dur="1.016">aviation,</text>
<text start="394.094" dur="1.975">water distribution systems,</text>
<text start="397" dur="1.01">and the U.S. military,</text>
<text start="398.022" dur="4.071">
which alone uses about 140 million barrels of oil a year.
</text>
<text start="404" dur="4">
Fossil fuels are also essential for the creation of plastics and polymers,
</text>
<text start="408.005" dur="4.077">
key ingredients in computers, entertainment devices and clothing.
</text>
<text start="414.002" dur="2.087">
The global economy currently depends on endless growth,
</text>
<text start="416.094" dur="4.908">demanding an increasing supply of cheap energy.</text>
<text start="421.03" dur="2.978">We are so dependant on oil and other fossil fuels,</text>
<text start="424.01" dur="3">that even a small disruption in supply</text>
<text start="427.015" dur="3.025">
may have far-reaching effects on every aspect of our lives.
</text>
<text start="437.007" dur="4.993">ENERGY</text>
<text start="442.089" dur="3.913">Energy is the ability to do work.</text>
<text start="446.002" dur="9.998">
The average American today has available the energy equivalent of 150 slaves, working 24 hours a day.
</text>
<text start="456" dur="3.009">
Materials that store this energy for work are called fuels,
</text>
<text start="459.009" dur="2.991">Some fuels contain more energy than others.</text>
<text start="462" dur="4.004">This is called energy density.</text>
<text start="466.004" dur="3.996">Of these fuels, oil is the most critical.</text>
<text start="470" dur="1.01">The world consumes 30 billion barrels a year,</text>
<text start="471.052" dur="2.948">equal to 1 cubic mile of oil,</text>
<text start="474.09" dur="1.915">which contains as much energy</text>
<text start="476.04" dur="2.046">as would be generated from 52 nuclear power plants</text>
<text start="478.086" dur="3">working for the next 50 years.</text>
<text start="483" dur="4">
Although oil only generates 1.6% of U.S. electricity,
</text>
<text start="487.057" dur="3">it powers 96% of all transportation.</text>
<text start="492.003" dur="3.004">
In 2008, two thirds of America&#39;s oil was imported.
</text>
<text start="496.039" dur="1.046">Most was from Canada,</text>
<text start="497.089" dur="1.911">Mexico,</text>
<text start="499.06" dur="1.969">Saudi Arabia,</text>
<text start="501.029" dur="1.044">Venezuela,</text>
<text start="502.073" dur="3.927">Nigeria, Iraq and Angola.</text>
<text start="507.005" dur="2.03">Several factors make oil unique:</text>
<text start="509.036" dur="1.989">it is energy dense.</text>
<text start="513.002" dur="1.087">One barrel of oil contains the energy equivalent</text>
<text start="514.09" dur="2.934">of almost three years of human labour.</text>
<text start="518.05" dur="1.01">It is liquid at room temperature,</text>
<text start="519.07" dur="1.99">easy to transport</text>
<text start="521.084" dur="2.921">and usable in small engines.</text>
<text start="525.007" dur="3.025">To acquire energy, you have to use energy.</text>
<text start="529" dur="4.02">
The trick is to use smaller amounts to find and extract larger amounts.
</text>
<text start="533.02" dur="2.042">This is called EROEI:</text>
<text start="535.062" dur="3.975">Energy Return on Energy Invested.</text>
<text start="541.05" dur="2.95">Conventional oil is a good example.</text>
<text start="544" dur="3.057">
The easy to extract, high-quality crude was pumped first.
</text>
<text start="548.089" dur="5.971">
Oilmen spent the energy equivalent of 1 barrel of oil to find and extract 100.
</text>
<text start="555.003" dur="3.047">The EROEI of oil was 100.</text>
<text start="559.008" dur="1.992">As the easy to find oil was pumped first,</text>
<text start="561.01" dur="2.079">exploration moved into deep waters,</text>
<text start="563.095" dur="1.978">or distant countries,</text>
<text start="565.073" dur="3.006">using increasing amounts of energy to do so.</text>
<text start="569.009" dur="2.991">Often, the oil we find now is heavy or sour crude,</text>
<text start="572" dur="2.064">and is expensive to refine.</text>
<text start="575.089" dur="3.972">The EROEI for oil today is as low as 10.</text>
<text start="580.003" dur="3.08">
If you use more energy to get the fuel than is contained in the fuel,
</text>
<text start="583.083" dur="2.993">it&#39;s not worth the effort to get it.</text>
<text start="590" dur="2.073">
It is possible to convert one fuel source into another.
</text>
<text start="593.05" dur="0.954">Every time you do so,</text>
<text start="594.02" dur="4.003">
some of the energy contained in the original fuel is lost.
</text>
<text start="599.002" dur="1.087">For instance, there is unconventional oil:</text>
<text start="600.095" dur="2.946">Tar Sands and Shale.</text>
<text start="604.002" dur="2.058">Tar Sands are found mainly in Canada.</text>
<text start="607" dur="2.089">Two thirds of the world&#39;s shale is in the US.</text>
<text start="611.009" dur="2.051">
Both of these fuels can be converted to synthetic crude oil.
</text>
<text start="613.061" dur="3.948">
However, this requires large amounts of heat and fresh water,
</text>
<text start="617.01" dur="1.079">reducing their EROEI,</text>
<text start="618.09" dur="4.911">
which varies from five, to as low as one and a half.
</text>
<text start="624.05" dur="1.95">Shale is an exceptionally poor fuel,</text>
<text start="626.02" dur="2.994">
pound for pound containing about one third the energy
</text>
<text start="629.015" dur="1.995">of a box of breakfast cereal.</text>
<text start="633.003" dur="1.067">Coal exists in vast quantities,</text>
<text start="634.07" dur="3.961">
and generates almost half of the planet&#39;s electricity.
</text>
<text start="639" dur="2.039">
The world uses almost 2 cubic miles of coal a year.
</text>
<text start="641.05" dur="5.037">
However, Global coal production may peak before 2040.
</text>
<text start="648.008" dur="2.067">
The claim that America has centuries worth of coal is deceptive,
</text>
<text start="650.075" dur="5.019">
as it fails to account for growing demand, and decreasing quality.
</text>
<text start="656.005" dur="2.061">Much of the high quality anthracite coal is gone,</text>
<text start="658.066" dur="4.945">
leaving lower quality coal that is less energy dense.
</text>
<text start="664.005" dur="2.065">
Production issues arise, as surface coal is depleted,
</text>
<text start="666.07" dur="4.01">
and miners have to dig deeper and in less accessible areas.
</text>
<text start="671.01" dur="3.019">
Many use destructive mountaintop removal to reach coal deposits,
</text>
<text start="674.03" dur="2.974">causing environmental mayhem.</text>
<text start="680.001" dur="2.074">Natural gas is often found alongside oil and coal.</text>
<text start="684" dur="3.039">
North American discovery of conventional gas peaked in the 1950s,
</text>
<text start="687.04" dur="2.988">and production peaked in the early 70s.</text>
<text start="691.002" dur="3.01">
If the discovery graph is moved forward by 23 years,
</text>
<text start="694.012" dur="4.048">
the possible future of North American conventional natural gas production
</text>
<text start="698.06" dur="1.94">is revealed.</text>
<text start="701.004" dur="3.075">
Recent breakthroughs have allowed the extraction of unconventional natural gas,
</text>
<text start="704.079" dur="5.927">
such as shale gas, which might help offset decline in the years ahead.
</text>
<text start="711.004" dur="3.016">Unconventional natural gas is controversial,</text>
<text start="714.02" dur="3.036">as it needs high energy prices to be profitable.</text>
<text start="718.006" dur="1.069">Even with Unconventional gas,</text>
<text start="719.075" dur="5.947">
there may be a peak in global natural gas production by 2030.

Large uranium reserves for nuclear fission still exist.
</text>
<text start="732.002" dur="3.081">
To replace the 10 terawatts the world currently generates from fossil fuels,
</text>
<text start="735.083" dur="3.94">would require 10,000 nuclear power plants.</text>
<text start="739.025" dur="5.004">
At that rate, the known reserves of uranium would last for only 10 to 20 years.

Experiments with plutonium based fast-breeder reactors
</text>
<text start="749.008" dur="2.002">in France and Japan</text>
<text start="751.01" dur="2.034">have been expensive failures.</text>
<text start="753.068" dur="4.005">Nuclear fusion faces massive technical obstacles.</text>
<text start="759.002" dur="1.027">Then there are the renewables.</text>
<text start="760.03" dur="5.005">Windpower has a high EROEI, but is intermittent.</text>
<text start="765.06" dur="1.979">Hydro power is reliable,</text>
<text start="767.04" dur="3.045">
but most rivers in the developed world are already dammed.
</text>
<text start="772.003" dur="1.997">Conventional geothermal power plants</text>
<text start="774" dur="2.089">
use existing hotspots near the Earth&#39;s surface.
</text>
<text start="777" dur="2.058">They are limited to those areas.</text>
<text start="781.002" dur="1.073">In the experimental EGS system,</text>
<text start="782.075" dur="3.929">two shafts would be drilled 6 miles deep.</text>
<text start="786.004" dur="3.012">
Water is pumped down one shaft, to be heated in fissures,
</text>
<text start="789.016" dur="3.029">then rise up the other, generating power.</text>
<text start="793.009" dur="2.02">According to a recent MIT report,</text>
<text start="795.03" dur="5.988">
this technology might supply 10% of US electricity by 2050.
</text>
<text start="802.009" dur="3.024">Wave power is restricted to coastal areas.</text>
<text start="805.033" dur="4.006">
The energy density of waves varies from region to region.

<text start="811.001" dur="4.008">
Transporting wave-generated electricity inland would be challenging.

<text start="1347" dur="1.018">The global food supply</text>
<text start="1348.018" dur="1.072">relies heavily on fossil fuels.</text>
<text start="1352.003" dur="1.011">Before WW1,</text>
<text start="1353.014" dur="2.032">all agriculture was Organic.</text>
<text start="1356.003" dur="3.077">
Following the invention of fossil fuel derived fertilisers and pesticides
</text>
<text start="1359.08" dur="2.97">
there were massive improvements in food production,
</text>
<text start="1362.059" dur="2.97">allowing for increases in human population.</text>
<text start="1368.009" dur="1.03">The use of artificial fertilisers</text>
<text start="1369.039" dur="2.02">
has fed far more people than would have been possible
</text>
<text start="1371.06" dur="3.027">with organic agriculture alone.</text>
<text start="1376.004" dur="2.031">Fossil fuels are needed for farming equipment,</text>
<text start="1378.035" dur="1.046">transportation,</text>
<text start="1379.075" dur="0.995">refrigeration,</text>
<text start="1381.006" dur="1.049">packaging - in plastic,</text>
<text start="1382.055" dur="2.012">and cooking.</text>
<text start="1385" dur="3.087">
Modern agriculture uses land to turn fossil fuels into food
</text>
<text start="1388.087" dur="1.972">- and food into people.</text>
<text start="1392" dur="1.092">About 7 calories of fossil-fuel energy</text>
<text start="1393.092" dur="3">are used to produce 1 calorie of food.</text>
<text start="1399.029" dur="5.973">
In America, food travels approximately 1,500 miles from farm to customer.
</text>
<text start="1410.008" dur="1.044">Besides fossil fuel decline,</text>
<text start="1411.052" dur="3.037">
there are several threats to the current system of food production:
</text>
<text start="1415.02" dur="1.013">Cheap energy,</text>
<text start="1416.033" dur="1.059">improved technology</text>
<text start="1417.092" dur="3.942">and subsidies have allowed massive fish catches.</text>
<text start="1423.009" dur="2.061">
Global fish catches peaked in the late nineteen eighties,
</text>
<text start="1425.07" dur="3">forcing fishermen to move into deep waters.</text>
<text start="1433.008" dur="2.063">Nitrogen run off by fossil fuel based fertilisers</text>
<text start="1435.071" dur="3.979">
poisons rivers and seas, creating enormous dead zones.
</text>
<text start="1440.05" dur="0.98">At this rate,</text>
<text start="1441.03" dur="2.067">all fish populations are projected to collapse</text>
<text start="1443.097" dur="1.996">by 2048.</text>
<text start="1447.009" dur="4.022">
Acid rain from cities and industries leeches the soil of vital nutrients,
</text>
<text start="1451.031" dur="1.004">such as potassium,</text>
<text start="1452.035" dur="0.986">calcium,</text>
<text start="1453.021" dur="1.029">and magnesium.</text>
<text start="1458.002" dur="2.007">Another threat is a lack of water.</text>
<text start="1460.02" dur="5">
Many farms use water pumped from underground aquifers for irrigation.
</text>
<text start="1466.004" dur="2.085">The aquifers need thousands of years to fill up,</text>
<text start="1468.089" dur="1.988">but can be pumped dry in a few decades,</text>
<text start="1470.077" dur="1.982">like oil wells.</text>
<text start="1474.002" dur="2.089">
America&#39;s massive Ogallala aquifer has fallen so low
</text>
<text start="1476.091" dur="3.984">
that many farmers have had to return to less productive dry-land farming.
</text>
<text start="1482.005" dur="4.052">
Additionally, The use of irrigation and fertilisers can lead to salinisation:
</text>
<text start="1487" dur="1.059">the accumulation of salt in the soil.</text>
<text start="1489.029" dur="2.021">This is a major cause of desertification.</text>
<text start="1493.007" dur="3.002">Still another threat is topsoil loss.</text>
<text start="1496.05" dur="1.015">200 years ago,</text>
<text start="1497.065" dur="2.994">
there were 6 feet of topsoil on the American prairies.
</text>
<text start="1501.009" dur="2.024">Today, through tillage and poor practices,</text>
<text start="1503.033" dur="3">approximately half is gone.</text>
<text start="1508.079" dur="4.948">
Irrigation encourages the growth of stem rust fungi like UG-99
</text>
<text start="1513.027" dur="4.043">
- which has the potential to destroy 80% of the world&#39;s grain harvest.
</text>
<text start="1519" dur="1.008">According to Norman Borlaug,</text>
<text start="1520.008" dur="2.012">father of the Green Revolution,</text>
<text start="1522.029" dur="5.061">
stem rust &quot;has immense potential for social and human destruction.&quot;
</text>
<text start="1529.007" dur="2.993">The use of biofuels means that less land</text>
<text start="1532" dur="3.01">will be available for food production.</text>
<text start="1537.005" dur="2.015">An area has a finite carrying capacity.</text>
<text start="1540" dur="1.064">This is the number of animals or people</text>
<text start="1541.064" dur="2.015">that can live there indefinitely.</text>
<text start="1544.008" dur="3.041">
If a species overshoots the carrying capacity of that area,
</text>
<text start="1547.049" dur="4.021">
it will die back until the population returns to its natural limits.
</text>
<text start="1553.002" dur="1.014">The world has avoided this die-off</text>
<text start="1554.016" dur="2.024">by finding new lands to cultivate,</text>
<text start="1556.04" dur="1.047">or by increasing production,</text>
<text start="1557.087" dur="3.011">which has been possible largely thanks to oil.</text>
<text start="1561" dur="2.063">To continue growth,</text>
<text start="1563.063" dur="3.027">
more resources are required than the Earth can provide,
</text>
<text start="1567.009" dur="2.081">but no new planets are available.</text>
<text start="1571.007" dur="2.018">In the face of all these challenges,</text>
<text start="1573.029" dur="3.012">global food production must double by 2050</text>
<text start="1576.03" dur="2.06">to feed the growing world population.</text>
<text start="1581.004" dur="2.062">
1 billion people are already malnourished or starving.
</text>
<text start="1584.02" dur="3.039">
There will be challenges in feeding over 9 billion in the years to come,
</text>
<text start="1588.009" dur="3.081">

<text start="1620.027" dur="2.006">faster than they can be replenished.</text>
<text start="1623.09" dur="1.967">Even at a growth rate of 1%,</text>
<text start="1625.057" dur="2.963">an economy will double in 70 years.</text>
<text start="1630.001" dur="3.004">The problem is intensified by other factors:</text>
<text start="1633.005" dur="2.045">Globalisation allows people on one continent</text>
<text start="1635.05" dur="3">to buy goods and food made by those on another.</text>
<text start="1639.009" dur="1.066">The lines of supply are long,</text>
<text start="1640.075" dur="3">placing strains on a limited oil resource.</text>
<text start="1646.005" dur="3.028">
We now rely on distant countries for basic necessities.
</text>
<text start="1650.07" dur="2.009">Modern cities are fossil fuel dependent.</text>
<text start="1654.003" dur="2.056">Most Banking Systems are based on debt,</text>
<text start="1656.065" dur="3.937">
forcing people into a spiral of loans and repayments
</text>
<text start="1660.02" dur="1.059">- producing growth.</text>
<text start="1663.009" dur="3.011">What can be done in the face of these problems?</text>
<text start="1667.002" dur="1.057">Many believe that the crisis can be prevented</text>
<text start="1668.059" dur="1.966">through conservation,</text>
<text start="1670.025" dur="0.982">technology,</text>
<text start="1671.007" dur="1.049">smart growth,</text>
<text start="1672.056" dur="1.023">recycling,</text>
<text start="1673.08" dur="1.929">electric cars and hybrids,</text>
<text start="1675.01" dur="1.996">substitution,</text>
<text start="1677.006" dur="1.023">or voting.</text>
<text start="1680.009" dur="1.028">Conservation will save you money,</text>
<text start="1681.037" dur="2.032">but it alone won&#39;t save the planet.</text>
<text start="1685" dur="2.025">If some people cut back on oil use,</text>
<text start="1687.029" dur="2.061">the reduced demand will drive down the price,</text>
<text start="1689.09" dur="2.926">allowing others to buy it for less.</text>
<text start="1693" dur="0.058">In the same fashion,</text>
<text start="1693.058" dur="3.982">
a more efficient engine that uses less energy will,
</text>
<text start="1697.04" dur="3.05">paradoxically, lead to greater energy use.</text>
<text start="1701.09" dur="0.999">In the 19th century,</text>
<text start="1702.089" dur="2.964">English economist William Stanley Jevons</text>
<text start="1705.053" dur="2.956">realised that Better steam engines made coal</text>
<text start="1708.01" dur="2.99">a more cost effective fuel source,</text>
<text start="1711" dur="1.079">which led to the use of more steam engines,</text>
<text start="1712.079" dur="3">which increased total coal consumption.</text>
<text start="1717.008" dur="3.012">Growth of use will consume any energy or resources</text>
<text start="1720.02" dur="2.02">saved through conservation.</text>
<text start="1728.002" dur="0.068">Many believe that scientists</text>
<text start="1728.07" dur="3.029">will solve these problems with new technology.</text>
<text start="1732.05" dur="2.96">However, technology is not energy.</text>
<text start="1736.004" dur="1.086">Technology can channel energy into work,</text>
<text start="1737.09" dur="1.96">but it can&#39;t replace it.</text>
<text start="1740.029" dur="2.01">It also consumes resources:</text>
<text start="1742.039" dur="0.965">for instance;</text>
<text start="1743.004" dur="1.071">computers are made with one tenth</text>
<text start="1744.075" dur="2.995">of the energy needed to make a car.</text>
<text start="1748.087" dur="1.938">More advanced technologies</text>
<text start="1750.025" dur="1.99">may make the situation worse,</text>
<text start="1752.015" dur="2.028">as many require rare minerals,</text>
<text start="1754.043" dur="1.977">which are also approaching limits.</text>
<text start="1757.005" dur="0.078">For example,</text>
<text start="1757.083" dur="3.989">
97% of the world&#39;s Rare Earths are produced by China,
</text>
<text start="1761.072" dur="3.007">most from a single mine in inner Mongolia.</text>
<text start="1766.05" dur="2.033">These minerals are used in catalytic converters,</text>
<text start="1768.083" dur="1.971">aircraft engines,</text>
<text start="1770.054" dur="2.971">high efficiency magnets and hard drives,</text>
<text start="1773.025" dur="1.99">hybrid car batteries,</text>
<text start="1775.015" dur="1.02">lasers,</text>
<text start="1776.035" dur="1.023">portable X-Rays,</text>
<text start="1777.058" dur="2.022">shielding for nuclear reactors,</text>
<text start="1779.08" dur="1.99">compact discs,</text>
<text start="1781.07" dur="1.984">hybrid vehicle motors,</text>
<text start="1783.055" dur="1.976">low energy light-bulbs,</text>
<text start="1785.031" dur="1.025">fibre optics</text>
<text start="1786.056" dur="1.964">and flat-screen displays.</text>
<text start="1789.008" dur="3.046">
China has begun to consider restricting the export of these minerals,
</text>
<text start="1792.054" dur="1.975">as demand soars.</text>
<text start="1797.008" dur="3.067">
So called sustainable growth or smart growth won&#39;t help,
</text>
<text start="1800.075" dur="2.995">as it also uses non renewable metals and minerals</text>
<text start="1803.07" dur="1.967">in ever increasing quantities,</text>
<text start="1805.037" dur="2.014">including Rare Earths.</text>
<text start="1808.09" dur="1.96">Recycling will not solve the problem,</text>
<text start="1810.05" dur="1.008">as it requires energy,</text>
<text start="1811.058" dur="2.982">and the process is not 100% efficient.</text>
<text start="1816" dur="3.081">
It is only possible to reclaim a fraction of the material being recycled;
</text>
<text start="1819.081" dur="3">a large portion is lost forever as waste.</text>
<text start="1825.005" dur="2.054">Electric cars run on electricity.</text>
<text start="1828.005" dur="2.05">As most power is generated from fossil fuels,</text>
<text start="1830.055" dur="2.004">this is not a solution.</text>
<text start="1833.009" dur="4.017">
Also, cars of all types consume oil in their production.
</text>
<text start="1837.026" dur="3.994">
Each tire alone requires about 7 gallons of Petroleum.
</text>
<text start="1843.003" dur="4.03">
There are around 800 million cars in the world, as of 2010.
</text>
<text start="1847.04" dur="1.964">At current growth rates,</text>
<text start="1849.004" dur="3.091">this number would reach 2 billion by 2025.</text>
<text start="1853.09" dur="3.93">
It is unlikely that the planet can support this many vehicles for long,
</text>
<text start="1857.02" dur="2.059">regardless of their power source.</text>
<text start="1861.003" dur="1.047">Many economists believe</text>
<text start="1862.068" dur="2.964">
that the free market will substitute one energy source
</text>
<text start="1865.032" dur="2.008">with another through technological innovation.</text>
<text start="1868.009" dur="2.011">However, the main substitutes to oil</text>
<text start="1870.02" dur="2.009">face their own decline rates.</text>
<text start="1873.09" dur="4.966">
Substitution also fails to account for the time needed to prepare for a transition.
</text>
<text start="1880" dur="1.083">The U.S. Department of Energy&#39;s Hirsch report</text>
<text start="1881.083" dur="3.951">
estimates that at least 2 decades would be needed to prepare
</text>
<text start="1885.035" dur="2.055">for the effects of Peak Oil.</text>
<text start="1888.09" dur="2.927">The issues of energy shortages,</text>
<text start="1891.017" dur="1.989">resource depletion,</text>
<text start="1893.006" dur="1.069">topsoil loss,</text>
<text start="1894.075" dur="4.943">
and pollution are all symptoms of a single, larger problem:
</text>
<text start="1900.05" dur="2">Growth.</text>
<text start="1903.07" dur="2.963">
As long as our financial system demands endless growth,
</text>
<text start="1906.033" dur="2.996">reform is unlikely to succeed.</text>
<text start="1909.092" dur="2.962">What then, will the future look like?</text>
<text start="1914.003" dur="2.034">
Optimists believe that growth will continue forever,
</text>
<text start="1916.037" dur="1.043">without limits.</text>
<text start="1919.004" dur="3.008">
Pessimists think that we&#39;re heading towards a new Stone Age,
</text>
<text start="1922.012" dur="1.997">or extinction.</text>
<text start="1925.003" dur="1.038">The truth may lie between these extremes.</text>
<text start="1927.041" dur="4.055">
It is possible that society might fall back to a simpler state,
</text>
<text start="1932.009" dur="2.07">one in which energy use is a lot less.</text>
<text start="1936.002" dur="2.007">This would mean a harder life for most.</text>
<text start="1938.009" dur="0.061">More manual labour,</text>
<text start="1938.07" dur="1.971">more farm work,</text>
<text start="1940.041" dur="3.97">and local production of goods, food and services.</text>
<text start="1945.007" dur="3.043">
What should a person do to prepare for such a possible future?
</text>
<text start="1949.008" dur="4.021">
Expect a decrease in supplies of food and goods from far away places.
</text>
<text start="1954.01" dur="1.066">Start walking or cycling.</text>
<text start="1956.05" dur="2.957">Get used to using less electricity.</text>
<text start="1960.002" dur="1.007">Get out of debt.</text>
<text start="1961.09" dur="0.999">Try to avoid banks.</text>
<text start="1963.04" dur="1.989">Instead of shopping at big box stores,</text>
<text start="1965.03" dur="2.979">support local businesses.</text>
<text start="1968.015" dur="3.044">Buy food grown locally, at Farmers&#39; Markets.</text>
<text start="1971.06" dur="3.981">
Instead of a lawn, consider gardening to grow your own food.
</text>
<text start="1975.045" dur="1.964">Learn how to preserve it.</text>
<text start="1978.04" dur="1.96">Consider the use of local currencies</text>
<text start="1980" dur="2.05">should the larger economy cease to function,</text>
<text start="1982.05" dur="3">and develop greater self sufficiency.</text>
<text start="1987.001" dur="1.049">None of these steps will prevent Collapse,</text>
<text start="1988.05" dur="4">
but they might improve your chances in a low energy future,
</text>
<text start="1993.009" dur="2.032">one in which we will have to be more self reliant,</text>
<text start="1995.041" dur="3">as our ancestors once were.</text>
